# Барбарис

- type: entity
  name: barberry
  parent: FoodProduceBase
  id: StalkerFoodBarbaris
  description: This is a cherished fruit that can be found in abandoned gardens and abandoned areas of the Zone. Its bright red berries contrast with the dull palette of dead forests and crumbling buildings, attracting the attention of stalkers sophisticated in cooking and alchemy. Despite its beauty, barberry is an ambiguous symbol its sweet taste is deceptive, and only experienced stalkers are aware of its possible properties.
